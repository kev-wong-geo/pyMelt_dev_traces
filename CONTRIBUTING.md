# Contribution Guidelines
Contributions to pyMelt are welcomed. The package is designed to be easily expanded to add new melting regimes, the calculation of additional melting region properties, and the addition of other melting models. The structure of the code could also be improved to add class inheritence for lithology objects etc.

We encourage contributors to reach out to Simon Matthews (simonwmatthews@gmail.com) at any stage of the process. When documenting issues, please provide an example of code that generated the issue.
